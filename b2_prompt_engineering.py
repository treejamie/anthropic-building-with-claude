    ## Notes
    ✓ High protein spread throughout the day for optimal muscle synthesis  
    ✓ Carbs timed around workout for energy and recovery  
    ✓ Budget-friendly staple foods  
    ✓ Adjust portions based on actual training intensity
    </ideal_output>
    
    The solution comprehensively meets all mandatory requirements: includes daily caloric total, complete macronutrient breakdown, 6 meals with exact foods and portions with specific timing. All secondary criteria are satisfied and caloric total appropriately supports the athletes. The only minor gap is the absence of explicit post-workout meal timing recommendations.
